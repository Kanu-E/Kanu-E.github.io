In my Journey to becoming a software engineer. it was when I created my first web application which I named Budgetwise that I began to feel like I was getting somewhere. It was the first application that mimics the everyday usage of the average web user.

The project was created Sinatra a free  and open source software web application library written in Ruby dependent on the Rack web server interface. The Budget wise application allows a user to create a user account which gives them login acces to use the application to manage their outstanding expenses. It gives each user full CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functIon for any entry into the Application.

The application uses SQL to store user ond expenses data in seperate tables and activerecord acts as the ORM that is used to map ruby classes and instances to tables and their rows respectively. All these is then brought together through Sinatra the Web application framework that allows for users to make dynamic requests and get a reasonable output from the application.

I look forward to continuing to learn different aspects of software development this project makes me excited for what might be next to come in my coding journey.
