I am just coming to the end of my second week of what I hope would be an amazing  journey into the world of Software Development so I believe it is as good a time as any to talk about why I chose to embark on this journey.

FIrst of let me say a little bit about who I am. I am a 32 year old financial accountant who used to work in an asset management firm in Nigeria were i was working approximately 70 hours a week. and one day I decided that it was not for me anymore so I began working on it and I immigrated to  Texas in January and began doing research into a possible career change.

While looking to figure out what the next possible steps in my  carrer could be, I came to realise software is in just about any and every thing we do nowadays, from the cars we drive to how we cook, business solutions, how we shop and the T.V we watch. That got me thinking I would love to understand how it all works and be a part of it. This led me to decide that a career in software development would be the best step for me.
