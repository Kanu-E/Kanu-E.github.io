I am just coming to the end of my second week of what I hope would be an amazing journey into the world of Software Development so I believe it is as good a time as any to talk about why I chose to embark on this journey.

FIrst  of let me say a little bit about who I am. I am a 32 year old financial accountant. Up until a few months ago, I was working in an asset management firm in Nigeria were I was working approximately 70 hours a week. The lack of creativity in the field of finance got me to realize that it was no longer the field for me so I began working on what the next step might be for me. That was when I immigrated to Texas and began doing research into a possible career change.

I had always wanted to go learn to code but never did have the resources that will help me get to where I wanted to be then I began doing a lot of research and that was when I found that coding boot camps could help, that's how I came accross Flatiron school. 

Now that I have begun the process of becoming a software engineer it is looking very promising and I cannot wait to see how the journey unfolds but you can be rest assured I will keep you abreast every step of the way.
